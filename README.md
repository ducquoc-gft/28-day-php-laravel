28 day PHP Laravel
==========

Learning journey with PHP programming language - and with Laravel framework.

Some tips for beginners/novices as a "cheat sheet" to learn quicker.
Mostly language features & stdlib up to PHP 8 release (2020 Nov), though 8.2+ is recommended.

### Usage

**Basic Usage**

There are sub directories of root directory, which are Laravel projects.
You may try to run one of the sample projects, given `php` and `composer` has been installed on your machine.

### Samples
```bash
  $ cd example-app
  $ cat config/app.php
```

#### Running samples

```
  $ php artisan serve
```

The application will be accessible (to browsers) at `http://localhost:8000` by default.
